Overview
The website I have created is a history website. It is about the history of human evolution. It's purpose is to give information to anyone who has a thirst for history and wants to regularly stay updated on any human evolution news. It has three pages:

Home
News

Navigation
The navigation is at the top of each page and it makes all the pages link with each other.
When you hover over a page name it changes colour and when you click on a page it will change a different colour.
The colours used all work well with each other.

Home Page
Underneath the header on the home page their is a column split into two.
There is text on the left side of the column giving an explanation of human evolution.
On the right side of the column there is a photo of humans from many many years ago.
Underneath these two columns is the main section of the website - the timeline.
The timeline is created using a list.
The timeline gives a breif description of the event and some of them have images which are also placed in columns just like the ones above. This is so the images can take up half the screen.
The timeline uses a combination of orange, white and yellow text.
At the bottom of the home page is a video that can be played.

News Page
The news page gives any up to date information on human evolution. Perfect for anyone who is really interested in history and wants to find out anything new.
Just like the home page, the news page uses a list and similar colours.
There is the date at the end of each updated news so you will know how recent it is.

Contact Page
The contact page has a form if you want to send us a message, usually for business reasons.
There are three fields: Name, Email, Subject, Message.
You are required to fill in each field otherwise a message will pop up.

Bugs
I had issues getting the image to be the size I want to be in the columns on the home page. To fix this I added this code in my CSS:
img {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
  }
 All of the bugs have been fixed. 

Testing
I opened my website in the Safari and Brave browsers and it works.
I used media enquiries to make the website responsive and I tested it out and it works on smaller devices.

I put my code in to the HTMl validator and there were no errors - https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input

Credits
I used external code from w3schools to help me build the website and have commented every link in each of the pages.
For the actual text on each page, I found this online and rewrote it in my own words. Links to these websites are also commented in the respective pages.
I used images with a CC license and attributed the authors, which can be seen under each image.
