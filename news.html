            <h4>Ten million years sooner than previously believed, dense forests throughout eastern Africa began paving the way to open woodlands, promoting the emergence of upright apes that eventually gave rise to humans. A team that has been analyzing everything from ancient dirt to fossil ape bones at various locations in the area has come to that conclusion. It was once believed that the transition from dense forests to grasslands in eastern Africa didn't happen until approximately 10 million years ago, and it was believed it was this change that forced our ancestors to leave the trees and begin racing over the savannah.</h4>

            <h2>Humans wore leather clothing, according to a bone fragment from 39,000 years ago.</h2>

            <h4>According to an investigation of a 39,600-year-old bone with odd indentations, it served as a punch board for punching holes in leather. This finding reveals how in Europe, Homo Sapiens created clothing at that time to protect them from cold conditions. The bone was found at a location named Terrasses de la Riera dels Canyars which is close to Barcelona, Spain, and it came from the hip of a big mammal like a horse or bison. On its flat exterior, there are 28 puncture marks, including a linear row of 10 holes spaced roughly 5 millimeters apart as well as additional holes in more haphazard locations.</h4>

            <h4>Thousands of years earlier, Neanderthals frequently hunted and killed elephants in Europe, according to an investigation of the stone tool marks on a collection of bones. The discovery shows that either the prehistoric humans lived in bigger groups than previously thought or that they possessed techniques for treating the flesh to prevent spoilage.</h4>
